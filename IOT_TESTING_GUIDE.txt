# IoT Monitoring - Testing Different Risk Levels

**Updated**: December 9, 2025
**Issue**: Only showing low risk patients
**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Now supports all risk levels

---

## 🎯 How to Test Different Risk Levels

### Method 1: Click the Links on the Page ✅ EASIEST

When you open the IoT monitoring page, you'll now see a testing section with clickable links:

```
🧪 Test Different Risk Levels:
[Low Risk Patient] [Medium Risk Patient] [High Risk Patient]
```

Just click any link to instantly switch to that patient type!

---

### Method 2: Use URL Parameters

You can manually add URL parameters to test specific risk levels:

#### **Low Risk Patient** (15-25% risk)
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=low
```
**Expected Results:**
- Risk: 15-25% 🟢
- Temperature: ~37.0°C
- Heart Rate: ~70 BPM
- pH: ~7.4
- Blood Pressure: ~120/80
- Display: "LOW RISK - All parameters within acceptable range"

#### **Medium Risk Patient** (40-60% risk)
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=medium
```
**Expected Results:**
- Risk: 40-60% 🟡
- Temperature: ~37.6°C
- Heart Rate: ~85 BPM
- pH: ~7.3
- Blood Pressure: ~135/85
- Display: "MEDIUM RISK - Monitor closely and consider preventive measures"

#### **High Risk Patient** (70-90% risk)
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=high
```
**Expected Results:**
- Risk: 70-90% 🔴
- Temperature: ~38.2°C
- Heart Rate: ~95 BPM
- pH: ~7.2
- Blood Pressure: ~145/92
- Display: "HIGH RISK - Immediate intervention recommended"

---

### Method 3: Random Patient (Refresh)

Simply refresh the page without any URL parameters to get a random patient profile:

```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html
```

The system will randomly select from:
- 33% chance: Low Risk
- 33% chance: Medium Risk
- 33% chance: High Risk

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Problem
The page was always showing low risk patients because:
1. Random selection wasn't working properly
2. No easy way to test different risk levels

### Solution
1. ✅ Added URL parameter support (`?risk=low/medium/high`)
2. ✅ Added clickable test links on the page
3. ✅ Improved random distribution (equal 33% chance for each)
4. ✅ Better patient ID generation based on profile

## 📊 Risk Level Breakdown

| Risk Level | Baseline | Typical Range | Color | Patient Type |
|------------|----------|---------------|-------|--------------|
| **Low** | 15% | 15-25% | 🟢 Green | Healthy Patient |
| **Medium** | 25% | 40-60% | 🟡 Yellow | Moderate Risk Patient |
| **High** | 35% | 70-90% | 🔴 Red | High Risk Patient |

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open `http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html`
- [ ] Click "Low Risk Patient" link → Should show 15-25% risk (green)
- [ ] Click "Medium Risk Patient" link → Should show 40-60% risk (yellow)
- [ ] Click "High Risk Patient" link → Should show 70-90% risk (red)
- [ ] Refresh page without parameters → Should randomly select a profile
- [ ] Wait 3 seconds → Risk should update dynamically
- [ ] Check risk factors → Should list specific abnormal parameters

---

## 💡 Tips

### To Always See High Risk:
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=high
```

### To Always See Medium Risk:
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=medium
```

### To Always See Low Risk:
```
http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html?risk=low
```

### Alternative Keywords (also work):
- `?risk=normal` = Low Risk
- `?risk=moderate` = Medium Risk
- `?risk=critical` = High Risk

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

### Low Risk (15-25%)
- **Color**: 🟢 Green
- **Message**: "LOW RISK - All parameters within acceptable range"
- **Factors**: "All vital signs within normal range - Baseline risk only"

### Medium Risk (40-60%)
- **Color**: 🟡 Yellow
- **Message**: "MEDIUM RISK - Monitor closely and consider preventive measures"
- **Factors**: Shows 1-2 elevated parameters

### High Risk (70-90%)
- **Color**: 🔴 Red
- **Message**: "HIGH RISK - Immediate intervention recommended"
- **Factors**: Shows 3+ abnormal parameters with "Multiple abnormal parameters" warning

---

## ✅ Verification

**Before Fix**: Always showed ~15-20% (low risk only)
**After Fix**: Shows appropriate risk based on patient profile:
- Low: 15-25%
- Medium: 40-60%
- High: 70-90%

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Start server** (if not running):
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\lenovo\report\proteomorphic
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open IoT page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000/iot-monitoring.html
   ```

3. **Click the colored links** to test different risk levels!

**Status**: ✅ ALL RISK LEVELS NOW WORKING
**Testing**: Easy with clickable links
**Dynamic Updates**: Every 3 seconds
**Ready for**: Demo and presentation
