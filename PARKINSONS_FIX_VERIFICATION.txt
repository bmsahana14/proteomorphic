# Parkinson's Protein Classification - FIX VERIFICATION

**Date**: December 9, 2025
**Issue**: Parkinson's proteins showing as "properly folded" instead of "misfolded"
**Status**: ✅ FIXED

---

## 🔍 **Problem Identified**

When analyzing Parkinson's disease proteins, the system was incorrectly classifying them as healthy/properly folded.

### **Root Cause**

1. **"Parkin" was in healthy proteins list** (line 422)
   - Parkin can be mutated in Parkinson's disease
   - Should be in disease proteins list, not healthy list

2. **Missing Parkinson's keywords**
   - "parkinson" keyword not in disease list
   - "lrrk2" (common Parkinson's gene) not included
   - "alpha-synuclein" variations not covered

---

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **Changes Made**

#### **1. Removed Parkin from Healthy List**

**Before**:
```javascript
// Neuroprotective proteins
'parkin', 'pink1', 'dj-1', 'uchl1', 'nurr1'
```

**After**:
```javascript
// Neuroprotective proteins (removed parkin - can be disease-causing when mutated)
'pink1', 'dj-1', 'uchl1', 'nurr1'
```

#### **2. Enhanced Disease Proteins List**

**Before**:
```javascript
const diseaseProteins = [
    'amyloid', 'app', 'tau', 'mapt', 'synuclein', 'snca',
    'huntingtin', 'htt', 'prion', 'prp', 'sod1', 'tdp-43',
    'fus', 'ataxin', 'polyglutamine', 'cftr', 'brca', 'tp53'
];
```

**After**:
```javascript
const diseaseProteins = [
    // Alzheimer's
    'amyloid', 'app', 'tau', 'mapt', 'psen', 'presenilin',
    
    // Parkinson's ← ENHANCED!
    'synuclein', 'alpha-synuclein', 'α-synuclein', 'snca', 
    'lrrk2', 'parkin', 'park', 'parkinson',
    
    // Huntington's
    'huntingtin', 'htt',
    
    // Prion diseases
    'prion', 'prp', 'prnp',
    
    // ALS
    'sod1', 'tdp-43', 'tdp43', 'fus', 'c9orf72',
    
    // Other neurodegenerative
    'ataxin', 'polyglutamine', 'polyq',
    
    // Other diseases
    'cftr', 'brca', 'tp53', 'p53'
];
```

## 🎓 **Why This Matters**

### **Scientific Accuracy**

```
Parkinson's Disease is caused by:
├─ Alpha-Synuclein misfolding (most common)
├─ LRRK2 mutations (genetic)
├─ Parkin mutations (early-onset)
└─ Other PARK genes

These proteins MUST show:
✅ HIGH misfolding risk
✅ Disease association
✅ CRISPR intervention available
❌ NOT "properly folded"
```
