Run these commands in your terminal (PowerShell or Command Prompt):

```bash
# Navigate to your project folder

## ⚠️ If You Get "Remote Already Exists" Error

git remote remove origin

# Add the correct one
git remote add origin https://github.com/bmsahana14/-proteomorphic.git

# Then push
git push -u origin main
```
